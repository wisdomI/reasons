        By now you should already know that you mean a lot to me... even if you
        don't, do not worry... I will tell you the Reasons why. Brace yourself
        up!! Here are some reasons why I love you <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            You are very driven - Your drive is annoying to lazy people and in
            the same vain inspiring to those who want to make something of their
            lives. So yes.. this is a loving point for me.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can cook - Now when I say you can cook ehn... You're good abeg!!!
            Both cooking up mumu stories (that I find funny but act like you're dry,
            I mean this in a good way ooo) and cooking great meals too. It's your drive
            in the kitchen for me, where you dey see all those energy from?? But yeah, 
            I love you and cannot wait to eat your meals forever. Eat both the cook and 
            the cooked! üåöüåö  
          </li>
          <li>
            Nobody comes close to you and remains the same - Fr! You're a force B, I don't
            know if you do not see it oo but nahh!!! Your're a very big force. People 
            misunderstand this particular quality of yours and I understand because 
            I used to be people and people used to be me. I've grown to understand this 
            part of you and emulate as much as I can.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your legs and the hair on them - You already know this... Those legs are something,
            they are the embodyment of what it means to have beautiful legs, the hairs on them
            were properly and intentionally arranged upon them to comfort me, merely rubbing those
            legs... things happen üòâüòúüòè, good things actually do happen. 
          </li>
          <li>
            You're a soft hard girl - I actually wish I knew this earlier. I wish I realized this 
            fact quicker but then, it is all good. You,re such a selfless individual and it amazes
            and inspires me. I've seen you go all out for people and I amm rest assured thatwith you,
            I won in life, i only hope that same can be said of me and if it can't be said at this time,
            I'll work tirelessly to see that time come.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are beautiful - I am not talking about just inner beauty oo, because ontop your body, 
            your face, your shape, God actually finish work. You're sexy, beautifulllllllllllllllllll
            and sweet too. You should be the synonym of 'excellent work of art by the master artist'.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        These are just but few reasons why i love you, the list is endless and I hope you liked the whole 
        concept. I Love You Glory Alphonsus Sussana Kosisochukwu. <br />
        Bye for now! üëãüèΩ <br />
        <br />
        About the images... I just wanted to cast your mind back from wherence we're coming. I miss you so 
        much, and I hope you like the playlist I cooked up for you my love... I hav to sneak some rap songs 
        there cos a love playlist I make would be incomplete without that genre.
